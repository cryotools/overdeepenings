# Subglacial overdeepenings
Shapefiles of subglacial overdeepenings representing possible locations of future glacial lakes in High Mountain Asia including a first-order GLOF hazard assessment at each site.

This dataset can be used for anticipating emerging threats and potentials connected to glacial lakes and as a basis for further studies at suspected GLOF hazard hotspots.

This study is part of the [GLAMoR](https://hu.berlin/glamor) project. 

### Detailed information
This dataset contains two shapefiles of subglacial overdeepenings in High Mountain Asia. 
1. *overdeepenings_HMA_large.shp*: A shapefile containing only overdeepenings with a surface area >10<sup>5</sup>  m<sup>2</sup>.
1. *overdeepenings_HMA_complete.shp*: A shapefile containing all subglacial overdeepenings in High Mountain Asia with a surface area >10<sup>4</sup>  m<sup>2</sup>. 

Further information can be found in the METADATA.md file.
